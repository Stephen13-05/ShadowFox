# Part 1: Matplotlib

## 1. Overview

Matplotlib is a foundational Python library for data visualization, originally developed by John D. Hunter in 2003 as an open-source alternative to MATLAB's plotting capabilities. Over the years, it has become the standard plotting library in the Python ecosystem, forming the basis for many higher-level tools such as Seaborn and Pandas plotting interfaces.

It provides extensive control over all aspects of a figure, from axes and ticks to lines and markers, making it ideal for creating publication-quality visuals. Its MATLAB-like interface allows for ease of transition for users from engineering and scientific backgrounds, while its object-oriented API supports scalable and flexible development.

Matplotlib is widely used across diverse domains, including scientific research, engineering, finance, and machine learning. In particular, it's favored in situations that require precise figure customization, detailed annotation, or export to vector graphics for professional publications. In finance, it is used to chart stock price movements, while in machine learning, it's used to visualize model accuracy over training epochs or plot confusion matrices.

With support for multiple backends, seamless integration with popular data science libraries like NumPy and Pandas, and extensive documentation and community support, Matplotlib remains a go-to solution for static visualizations in Python.

**Key Features:**

- Supports static, animated, and interactive plots

- Offers extensive customization of plots
- Compatible with various file formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.)

**Use Cases:**

- Scientific research and engineering
- Finance and quantitative analysis
- Machine learning model diagnostics
- Custom dashboards
- Report-ready visuals

## 2. Graph Types

### a. Line Plot

A line plot is a type of chart used to display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. It is typically used to show trends over time or to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.

**Use Case:** Showing trends over time or continuous data. For example, in weather monitoring, line plots can be used to track temperature changes over a week.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X Axis")
plt.ylabel("Y Axis")
plt.show()
```

### b. Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is a type of graph used to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. It uses Cartesian coordinates to show the relationship between two continuous variables, with each point representing an observation.

**Use Case:** Revealing relationships or patterns between variables. For example, a data scientist might use a scatter plot to observe the relationship between advertising budget and product sales.

```python
x = [5, 7, 8, 7, 2]
y = [99, 86, 87, 88, 100]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.title("Scatter Plot")
plt.show()
```

### c. Bar Chart

A bar chart is a graph that represents categorical data with rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. It is particularly effective for comparing different categories or groups within a dataset.

**Use Case:** Comparing categorical values. For instance, a business may use a bar chart to compare sales performance across different product categories.

```python
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C']
values = [10, 24, 36]

plt.bar(categories, values)
plt.title("Bar Chart")
plt.show()
```

### d. Histogram

A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges or bins. It is used to summarize the distribution of a dataset, often providing insight into the data’s central tendency, variability, and shape.

**Use Case:** Displaying the frequency distribution of data. For example, in education, a histogram can be used to visualize the distribution of student exam scores across different grade intervals.

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.random.randn(1000)
plt.hist(data, bins=30)
plt.title("Histogram")
plt.show()
```

### e. Pie Chart

A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. Each slice represents a category's contribution to the whole.

**Use Case:** Representing data proportions. For example, a company might use a pie chart to show how its annual budget is distributed across departments.

```python
labels = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++']
sizes = [45, 30, 25]

plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title("Pie Chart")
plt.show()
```

### f. Box Plot

A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. It displays the median, upper and lower quartiles, and potential outliers in a dataset.

**Use Case:** Summarizing distribution and outliers. For instance, in finance, box plots can compare the spread of monthly returns across multiple investment portfolios.

```python
data = [7, 15, 13, 19, 12, 8, 6, 10, 17]
plt.boxplot(data)
plt.title("Box Plot")
plt.show()
```

sns.scatterplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)
plt.title("Scatter Plot")
plt.show()
```

### c. Bar Chart

A bar chart in Seaborn displays the mean (or other aggregate measure) of a numeric variable for each category, with optional confidence intervals.

**Use Case:** Aggregated comparison of categories. For instance, analyzing the average bill amount per day of the week.

```python
sns.barplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)
plt.title("Bar Chart")
plt.show()
```

### d. Histogram

A histogram in Seaborn helps visualize the distribution of a single numeric variable.

**Use Case:** Distribution analysis of numerical data. For example, visualizing how customer spending varies across transactions.

```python
sns.histplot(tips["total_bill"], bins=20)
plt.title("Histogram")
plt.show()
```

### e. Box Plot

A box plot in Seaborn shows the distribution of a numeric variable across different categories, highlighting medians and outliers.

**Use Case:** Comparing distribution and outliers across categories. For instance, comparing restaurant bills across different days.

```python
sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)
plt.title("Box Plot")
plt.show()
```

### f. Violin Plot

A violin plot combines a box plot and a KDE plot to provide detailed information about the distribution of the data.

**Use Case:** Distribution and density visualization. For example, examining bill size variability for different dining times.

```python
sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)
plt.title("Violin Plot")
plt.show()
```

### g. Heatmap

A heatmap displays values in a matrix form using color intensities. It's useful for visualizing correlation matrices or tabular data.

**Use Case:** Correlation matrix or data intensity visualization. For instance, visualizing the number of passengers per month across years.

```python
sns.heatmap(df, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.title("Heatmap")
plt.show()
```
